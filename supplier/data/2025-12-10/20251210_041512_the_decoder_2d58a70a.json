  "summary": "OpenAI의 'State of Enterprise AI 2025' 보고서에 따르면, ChatGPT Enterprise 사용자는 활동적인 업무일 기준 평균 40~60분을 절약하며, 데이터 과학자, 엔지니어, 커뮤니케이션 담당자는 최대 80분까지 절약하는 것으로 나타났습니다. 응답자의 75%는 AI가 작업 속도 또는 품질을 개선했다고 답했습니다. AI 활용 범위가 넓을수록 시간 절약 효과가 크며, 상위 5%의 '프론티어 워커'는 중앙값 사용자보다 6배 더 많은 메시지를 전송하는 등 사용자 간 사용 강도 차이가 큰 것으로 조사되었습니다. 보고서는 익명의 사용 데이터와 9,000명의 유료 고객 설문조사를 기반으로 합니다.",

Content Summary OpenAI's new enterprise report paints a rosy picture of AI productivity gains. Ad According to OpenAI's \"State of Enterprise AI 2025\" report, ChatGPT Enterprise users save an average of 40 to 60 minutes per active workday. Workers in data science, engineering, and communications report even bigger gains, up to 80 minutes daily. 75 percent of surveyed workers said AI improved either the speed or quality of their work. The impact varies by role: 87 percent of IT workers report faster problem-solving, 85 percent of marketing and product teams say they execute campaigns faster, and 73 percent of engineers say they ship code more quickly. The analysis draws on anonymized usage data from OpenAI's enterprise products and a survey of 9,000 employees across nearly 100 companies, all of them paying OpenAI customers.

Those who apply it to around seven different task types report five times more time savings than users who stick to just four task types. Heavy users also tap into advanced features like deep research and reasoning models more often. Share Recommend our article Share 75 percent of users also say they can now handle tasks they couldn't do before—things like programming support, code review, spreadsheet analysis, automation, and building technical tools. Users saving more than ten hours per week consume eight times more credits than those reporting no time savings. Enterprise adoption keeps climbing Message volume on ChatGPT Enterprise has grown eightfold since November 2024, while Enterprise seats increased ninefold year-over-year. Average reasoning token consumption per organization jumped 320-fold, which OpenAI says indicates increased use of advanced AI models that think longer and generate more tokens. Whether token consumption actually measures AI success is debatable. Growth varies by sector. The median industry grew more than sixfold year-over-year. Technology leads with 11x growth, followed by healthcare (8x) and manufacturing (7x). By total customer count, Professional Services, Finance, and Technology have the most ChatGPT Enterprise users. Weekly users of custom GPTs and projects increased 19-fold. About 20 percent of all enterprise messages now go through a custom GPT or project. API usage patterns differ by industry: tech companies mainly build customer-facing applications like in-app assistants, professional services firms focus on coding and developer tools, and financial companies often start with customer support. International growth has outpaced the US overall, according to OpenAI. Country Business customer growth (Nov. 2024 to Nov. 2025) Australia 187% Brazil 161% Netherlands 153% France 146% Canada 144% Global average 143% USA 142% Germany 138% United Kingdom 133% Japan 130% The UK and Germany rank among the largest ChatGPT Enterprise markets outside the US by customer count. By message volume, Germany and Japan are among the most active. Big gap between power users and everyone else The report highlights stark differences in usage intensity. So-called frontier workers, the top 5 percent by adoption, send six times more messages than the median user. For coding tasks, that gap widens to 17 times. The pattern holds at the company level: top organizations generate roughly twice as many messages per seat as the median company and seven times more messages to GPTs. Many active users still haven't explored advanced features. Among monthly active users, 19 percent have never tried data analysis, 14 percent have never used reasoning, and 12 percent have never touched the search function. For daily active users, these numbers drop to between one and three percent. Ad",
