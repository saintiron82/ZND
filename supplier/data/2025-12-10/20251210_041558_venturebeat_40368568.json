  "summary": "마케팅 조직에서 AI가 생성하는 결과물이 브랜드나 전략적 목표와 일치하지 않는 문제의 원인은 AI의 역량 부족이 아닌 '컨텍스트(Context)'의 부재에 있습니다. BlueOcean의 Grant McDougall CEO는 마케팅 데이터가 '디지털', '로열티' 등 수직적으로 분리되어 있어 CMO가 요구하는 '수평적 인텔리전스(고객, 경쟁, 성과 등을 통합한 관점)'를 제공하지 못한다고 지적합니다. 브랜드 컨텍스트(브랜드 전략, 고객 통찰, 경쟁사 동향 등 구조화된 입력값)를 AI 시스템에 제공함으로써, AI가 단순한 콘텐츠 생성기가 아닌 전략적 파트너로서 더 샤프하고 신뢰할 수 있는 의사결정을 지원하게 됩니다. 이는 AI 활용의 초점이 '출력량'에서 '의사결정 품질'로 전환되고 있음을 반영합니다.",
  "text": "Presented by BlueOcean AI has become a central part of how marketing teams work, but the results often fall short. Models can generate content at scale and summarize information in seconds, yet the outputs are not always aligned with the brand, the audience, or the company’s strategic goals. The problem is not capability. The problem is the absence of context. The bottleneck is no longer computational power. It is contextual intelligence. Generative AI is powerful, but it doesn’t understand the nuances of the business it supports. It doesn’t have the context for why customers choose one brand over another or what creates competitive advantage. Without that grounding, AI operates as a fast executor rather than a strategic partner. It produces more, but it does not always help teams make better decisions. This becomes even more visible inside complex marketing organizations where insights live in different corners of the business and rarely come together in a unified way. As Grant McDougall, CEO of BlueOcean, explains, “Inside large marketing organizations, the data is vertical. Digital has theirs, loyalty has theirs, content has theirs, media has theirs. But CMOs think horizontally. They need to combine customer insight, competitive movement, creative performance, and sales signals into one coherent view. Connecting that data fundamentally changes how decisions get made.” This shift from vertical data to horizontal intelligence reflects a new phase in AI adoption. The emphasis is shifting from output volume to decision quality. Marketers are recognizing that the future of AI is intelligence that understands who you are as a company and why you matter to your customers. In BlueOcean’s work with global brands across technology, healthcare, and consumer industries, including Amazon, Cisco, SAP, and Intel, the same pattern appears. Teams move faster and make better decisions when AI is grounded in structured brand and competitive context. Why context is becoming the critical ingredient Large language models excel at producing language. They do not inherently understand brand, meaning, or intention. This is why generic prompts often lead to generic outputs. The model executes based on statistical prediction, not strategic nuance. Context changes that. When AI systems are supplied with structured inputs about brand strategy, audience insight, and creative intent, the output becomes sharper and more reliable. Recommendations become more specific. Creative stays on brief. The AI begins to act less like a content generator and more like a partner that understands the boundaries and goals of the business. This shift mirrors a key theme from BlueOcean’s recent report, Building Marketing Intelligence: The CMO Blueprint for Context-Aware AI. The report explains that AI is most effective when it is grounded in a clear frame of reference. CMOs who design these context-aware workflows see better performance, stronger creative, and more reliable decision-making. For a deeper exploration of these principles, the full report is available here. The industry’s pivot: From execution to understanding Many teams remain in an experimentation phase with AI. They test tools, run pilots, and explore new workflows. This creates productivity gains but not intelligence. Without shared context, every team uses AI differently, and the result is fragmentation. The companies making the clearest progress treat context as a shared layer across workflows. When teams pull from the same brand strategy, insights, and creative guidance, AI becomes more predictable and more valuable. It supports decisions rather than contradicting them. This becomes especially effective when the context includes external signals such as shifts in sentiment, competitor movement, content performance, and broader category trends. Brand-context AI connects brand identity, customer sentiment, competitive movement, and creative performance in a single environment. It strengthens workflows in practical ways: briefs become more strategic, content reviews more accurate, and insights faster because the system synthesizes patterns teams once assembled manually. Across enterprise teams supported by BlueOcean, this shift consistently unlocks clarity. AI becomes a contributor to strategic understanding rather than a generator of disconnected output. With shared context in place, teams make more confident, coherent, and aligned decisions. Structured context: What it actually includes Structured context is the intelligence marketers already curate to understand how their brand shows up in the world. It brings together the narrative elements that shape the brand’s voice, the customer motivations that influence messaging, the competitive signals unfolding in the market, and the creative patterns that have historically performed. It also includes the external brand signals teams monitor every day: sentiment shifts, content dynamics, press and social movement, and how competitors position themselves across channels. When this information is organized into a coherent frame, AI can interpret direction and creative choices with the same clarity strategists use. The value does not come from giving AI more data; it comes from giving it structure so it can reason through decisions the way marketers already do. The new division of labor between humans and AI The strongest AI-enabled marketing teams have one thing in common. They are clear about what humans own and what AI owns. Humans define purpose, strategy, and creative judgment. They understand emotion, cultural nuance, competitive meaning, and brand intent. AI delivers speed, scale, and precision. It excels at synthesizing information, producing iterations, and following structured instruction. “AI works best when it is given clear boundaries and clear intent,” says McDougall. “Humans set the direction led by creativity and imagination. AI executes with precision. That partnership is where the real value emerges.” The systems that perform best are the ones guided by human-defined boundaries and human-led strategy. AI provides scale, but people provide meaning. CMOs are recognizing that governing context is becoming a leadership responsibility. They already own brand, messaging, and customer insight. Extending this ownership into AI systems ensures the brand shows up consistently across every touchpoint, whether a human or a model produced the work. A practical example of context in action Consider a team preparing a global campaign. Without context, an AI system might generate copy that sounds polished but generic. It may overlook claims the brand can make, reference benefits competitors own, or ignore differentiators that matter most. It may even amplify a competitor’s message simply because that language appears frequently in public data. With structured context, the experience changes. The model understands the audience, the brand tone, the competitive landscape, and the objective. It knows which competitors are gaining attention, which messages resonate in the market, and where the brand has permission to play. It can propose angles that strengthen positioning rather than dilute it. It can generate variations that stay on brief and avoid competitor-owned territory. BlueOcean has observed this shift inside enterprise teams including Amazon, Intel, and SAP, where structured brand and competitive context has improved alignment and reduced drift at scale. Creative, brand, and competitive signals are no longer separate inputs. When they are connected and contextualized, AI begins supporting decision-making in a meaningful way. The technology stops producing output for its own sake and starts helping marketers understand where the brand stands and what actions will grow it. What comes next A new phase of AI is beginning. AI agents are evolving from task assistants to systems that collaborate across tools and workflows. As these systems become more capable, context will determine whether they behave unpredictably or perform as trusted extensions of the team. Brand-context AI provides a path forward. It gives AI systems the structure they need to operate consistently. It supports the teams responsible for protecting brand integrity. In practice, these agents can already assemble context-aware creative briefs, review content for competitive and brand alignment, monitor shifts in category messaging, and synthesize insights across products or markets. It creates intelligence that adapts rather than overwhelms. In the coming years, success will not come from producing more content, but from producing content anchored in brand context, the kind that sharpens decisions, strengthens positioning, and drives long-term growth. The companies that build on context today will define the generative enterprise of tomorrow. BlueOcean is helping leading enterprises shape the next generation of context-aware AI systems.",
