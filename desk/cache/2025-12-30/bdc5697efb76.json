    "text": "If you use a chatbot and an Urban browser extension, you might want to rethink that combination. Security researchers at Koi have found that eight browser extensions with more than eight million users combined are secretly harvesting AI conversations and potentially selling them to third parties.

Even when the VPN is switched off, data collection continues in the background. Uninstalling the extension is the only way to stop it.

Adding to the confusion, \"Featured\" badges from Google and Microsoft give users a false sense of security. Urban Ad Blocker for Edge is the only extension without a Featured badge.",
