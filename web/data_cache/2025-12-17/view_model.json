      "text": "For the last two years, the fundamental unit of generative AI development has been the \"completion.\" You send a text prompt to a model, it sends text back, and the transaction ends. If you want to continue the conversation, you have to send the entire history back to the model again. This \"stateless\" architecture—embodied by Google's legacy generateContent endpoint—was perfect for simple chatbots. But as developers move toward autonomous agents that use tools, maintain complex states, and \"think\" over long horizons, that stateless model has become a distinct bottleneck. Last week, Google DeepMind finally addressed this infrastructure gap with the public beta launch of the Interactions API ( /interactions ). While OpenAI began this shift back in March 2025 with its Responses API, Google’s entry signals its own efforts to advance the state-of-the-art. The Interactions API is not just a state management tool; it is a unified interface designed to treat LLMs less like text generators and more like remote operating systems. The 'Remote Compute' Model The core innovation of the Interactions API is the introduction of server-side state as a default behavior. Previously, a developer building a complex agent had to manually manage a growing JSON list of every \"user\" and \"model\" turn, sending megabytes of history back and forth with every request. With the new API, developers simply pass a previous_interaction_id . Google’s infrastructure retains the conversation history, tool outputs, and \"thought\" processes on their end. \"Models are becoming systems and over time, might even become agents themselves,\" wrote DeepMind's Ali Çevik and Philipp Schmid, in an official company blog post on the new paradigm. \"Trying to force these capabilities into generateContent would have resulted in an overly complex and fragile API.\" This shift enables Background Execution, a critical feature for the agentic era. Complex workflows—like browsing the web for an hour to synthesize a report—often trigger HTTP timeouts in standard APIs. The Interactions API allows developers to trigger an agent with background=true, disconnect, and poll for the result later. It effectively turns the API into a job queue for intelligence. Native \"Deep Research\" and MCP Support Google is using this new infrastructure to deliver its first built-in agent: Gemini Deep Research. Accessible via the same /interactions endpoint, this agent is capable of executing \"long-horizon research tasks.\" Unlike a standard model that predicts the next token based on your prompt, the Deep Research agent executes a loop of searches, reading, and synthesis. Crucially, Google is also embracing the open ecosystem by adding native support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This allows Gemini models to directly call external tools hosted on remote servers—such as a weather service or a database—without the developer having to write custom glue code to parse the tool calls. The Landscape: Google Joins OpenAI in the 'Stateful' Era Google is arguably playing catch-up, but with a distinct philosophical twist. OpenAI moved away from statelessness nine months ago with the launch of the Responses API in March 2025. While both giants are solving the problem of context bloat, their solutions diverge on transparency: OpenAI (The Compression Approach): OpenAI's Responses API introduced Compaction—a feature that shrinks conversation history by replacing tool outputs and reasoning chains with opaque \"encrypted compaction items.\" This prioritizes token efficiency but creates a \"black box\" where the model's past reasoning is hidden from the developer. Google (The Hosted Approach): Google’s Interactions API keeps the full history available and composable. The data model allows developers to \"debug, manipulate, stream and reason over interleaved messages.\" It prioritizes inspectability over compression. Supported Models & Availability The Interactions API is currently in Public Beta (documentation here) and is available immediately via Google AI Studio. It supports the full spectrum of Google’s latest generation models, ensuring that developers can match the right model size to their specific agentic task: Gemini 3.0: Gemini 3 Pro Preview. Gemini 2.5: Flash, Flash-lite, and Pro. Agents: Deep Research Preview ( deep-research-pro-preview-12-2025 ). Commercially, the API integrates into Google’s existing pricing structure—you pay standard rates for input and output tokens based on the model you select. However, the value proposition changes with the new data retention policies. Because this API is stateful, Google must store your interaction history to enable features like implicit caching and context retrieval. Access to this storage is determined by your tier. Developers on the Free Tier are limited to a 1-day retention policy, suitable for ephemeral testing but insufficient for long-term agent memory. Developers on the Paid Tier unlock a 55-day retention policy. This extended retention is not just for auditing; it effectively lowers your total cost of ownership by maximizing cache hits. By keeping the history \"hot\" on the server for nearly two months, you avoid paying to re-process massive context windows for recurring users, making the Paid Tier significantly more efficient for production-grade agents. Note: As this is a Beta release, Google has advised that features and schemas are subject to breaking changes. 'You Are Interacting With a System' Sam Witteveen, a Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning and CEO of Red Dragon AI, sees this release as a necessary evolution of the developer stack. \"If we go back in history... the whole idea was simple text-in, text-out,\" Witteveen noted in a technical breakdown of the release on YouTube. \"But now... you are interacting with a system. A system that can use multiple models, do multiple loops of calls, use tools, and do code execution on the backend.\" Witteveen highlighted the immediate economic benefit of this architecture: Implicit Caching. Because the conversation history lives on Google’s servers, developers aren't charged for re-uploading the same context repeatedly. \"You don't have to pay as much for the tokens that you are calling,\" he explained. However, the release is not without friction. Witteveen critiqued the current implementation of the Deep Research agent's citation system. While the agent provides sources, the URLs returned are often wrapped in internal Google/Vertex AI redirection links rather than raw, usable URLs. \"My biggest gripe is that... these URLs, if I save them and try to use them in a different session, they're not going to work,\" Witteveen warned. \"If I want to make a report for someone with citations, I want them to be able to click on the URLs from a PDF file... Having something like medium.com as a citation [without the direct link] is not very good.\" What This Means for Your Team For Lead AI Engineers focused on rapid model deployment and fine-tuning, this release offers a direct architectural solution to the persistent \"timeout\" problem: Background Execution. Instead of building complex asynchronous handlers or managing separate job queues for long-running reasoning tasks, you can now offload this complexity directly to Google. However, this convenience introduces a strategic trade-off. While the new Deep Research agent allows for the rapid deployment of sophisticated research capabilities, it operates as a \"black box\" compared to custom-built LangChain or LangGraph flows. Engineers should prototype a \"slow thinking\" feature using the background=true parameter to evaluate if the speed of implementation outweighs the loss of fine-grained control over the research loop. Senior engineers managing AI orchestration and budget will find that the shift to server-side state via previous_interaction_id unlocks Implicit Caching, a major win for both cost and latency metrics. By referencing history stored on Google’s servers, you automatically avoid the token costs associated with re-uploading massive context windows, directly addressing budget constraints while maintaining high performance. The challenge here lies in the supply chain; incorporating Remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) means your agents are connecting directly to external tools, requiring you to rigorously validate that these remote services are secure and authenticated. It is time to audit your current token spend on re-sending conversation history—if it is high, prioritizing a migration to the stateful Interactions API could capture significant savings. For Senior Data Engineers, the Interactions API offers a more robust data model than raw text logs. The structured schema allows for complex histories to be debugged and reasoned over, improving overall Data Integrity across your pipelines. However, you must remain vigilant regarding Data Quality, specifically the issue raised by expert Sam Witteveen regarding citations. The Deep Research agent currently returns \"wrapped\" URLs that may expire or break, rather than raw source links. If your pipelines rely on scraping or archiving these sources, you may need to build a cleaning step to extract the usable URLs. You should also test the structured output capabilities ( response_format ) to see if they can replace fragile regex parsing in your current ETL pipelines. Finally, for Directors of IT Security, moving state to Google’s centralized servers offers a paradox. It can improve security by keeping API keys and conversation history off client devices, but it introduces a new data residency risk. The critical check here is Google's Data Retention Policies: while the Free Tier retains data for only one day, the Paid Tier retains interaction history for 55 days.",

Content Summary The share of US employees using AI at work climbed from 40 to 45 percent between Q2 and Q3 2025, according to a recent Gallup poll. Ad Frequent use, meaning several times a week or more, grew from 19 to 23 percent during the same period. Daily use, however, only inched up from 8 to 10 percent. The findings come from a representative survey of 23,068 full-time and part-time employees in the US, conducted by Gallup between August 5 and 19, 2025. Share Recommend our article Share Chatbots and virtual assistants are the most popular workplace AI tools, with over 60 percent of users relying on them. AI-powered writing and editing tools are used by 36 percent, while coding assistants lag behind at just 14 percent. Specialized tools for data analysis or programming are still relatively uncommon overall, but frequent AI users depend on them much more. The difference is most pronounced with coding assistants: 22 percent of frequent users leverage these tools, compared to only 8 percent of less frequent users. This concentrated usage helps explain why companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are so fiercely competing for developer attention. Ad Ad THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. ✓ Weekly ✓ Free ✓ Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty Knowledge workers lead AI adoption while frontline industries lag behind Employees in knowledge-based fields use AI tools far more often. According to Gallup, 76 percent of workers in technology and IT use AI several times a year. In finance, that number drops to 58 percent, and professional services comes in at 57 percent. Industries with more frontline workers tell a different story: only 33 percent of retail employees use AI at work, along with 37 percent in healthcare and 38 percent in manufacturing. Among AI users, 42 percent use the technology to summarize information—which also happens to be Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's top AI use case. Another 41 percent use it to develop new ideas, and 36 percent use it to learn something new. According to Gallup, these percentages have barely changed since Q2 2024. Nearly a quarter of workers don't know if their company uses AI When asked whether their organization had implemented AI technology, 23 percent of respondents said they didn't know. Only 37 percent said yes, while 40 percent said no. The knowledge gap varies significantly by role. Among individual contributors without management responsibilities, 26 percent don't know, compared to 16 percent of managers and just 7 percent of executives. Part-time employees, on-site workers, and frontline staff also showed higher levels of uncertainty. Shadow AI thrives as workers hide their usage from employers Gallup points to a telling gap: 45 percent of employees use AI at least a few times a year, but only 37 percent know for certain that their company has officially adopted AI. This suggests some employees are using personal AI tools without knowing their employer's AI strategy. This so-called shadow AI use has appeared in previous studies as well. Sometimes the explanation is simple: the company just doesn't offer a useful tool. But social factors play a role too. According to a Slack survey, nearly half of all office workers wouldn't tell their managers they use AI. They worry about being considered lazy or incompetent, or they fear putting their jobs at risk. Microsoft and LinkedIn call this phenomenon \"AI shame\": 52 percent of AI users hesitate to admit they rely on AI for their core tasks, and 53 percent worry that using AI makes them look replaceable. Even when companies provide solid AI tools, employees may still prefer their own—especially if workplace tools track usage. Workers who don't want their employer seeing how much AI helps them would rather just pull up ChatGPT on their personal phone. Ad",

      "text": "(사진=셔터스톡) 오픈AI가 현금을 내지 않고도 디즈니의 지적재산권(IP)을 '소라' 앱에서 사용하는 라이선스 계약을 맺은 것으로 알려졌다. 대신, 오픈AI는 주식을 매입할 수 있는 옵션을 제공했다는 내용이다. 블룸버그는 16일(현지시간) 관계자를 인용, 이번 계약이 현금 라이선스 비용이 아닌 전액 주식 워런트(Stock Warrant) 지급 방식으로 이뤄졌다고 보도했다. 이를 통해 디즈니는 이미 발표한 10억달러 지분 투자 외에도 추가로 지분을 매입할 수 있는 옵션을 획득하게 됐다. 이는 소라가 성공하면, 디즈니가 앞으로 더 큰 이익을 가져갈 수 있는 구조다. 당장 라이선스 비용을 받는 것보다 앞으로 성장에 초점을 맞췄다는 평이다. 이처럼 이번 계약은 양사의 이해가 일치한다는 분석이다. 오픈AI는 이번 계약으로 미키 마우스와 어벤져스, 스타워즈 등 200종에 달하는 강력한 캐릭터의 사용권을 얻었다. 디즈니가 메타버스 전략에 따라 투자한 포트나이트 외에 AI 기업에 라이선스를 허락한 것은 처음이다. 대신, 디즈니가 구글에 캐릭터 무단 사용에 대해 경고하는 등 오픈AI의 경쟁력에 도움이 될 수 있다. 또 오픈AI는 이를 기반으로 할리우드 시장 진출의 발판을 만들었다는 평가다. 디즈니 외에도 유니버설 픽처스와 워너 브러더스 등 대형 스튜디오들과 소라 파트너십에 대해 논의해 온 것으로 알려져 있다. 여기에 오픈AI는 디즈니에 '챗GPT 엔터프라이즈'를 공급하기로 했다. 이로써 디즈니는 오픈AI의 대표적인 기업 고객 중 하나가 됐다. 오픈AI와 디즈니는 이에 대한 논평을 거부했다. 임대준 기자 ydj@aitimes.com",

      "text": "Fresh off releasing the latest version of its Olmo foundation model, the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) launched its open-source video model, Molmo 2, on Tuesday, aiming to show that smaller, open models can be viable options for enterprises focused on video understanding and analysis. In a press release , the company said Molmo 2 “takes Molmo’s strengths in grounded vision and expands them to video and multi-image understanding,” a capability that has largely been dominated by larger proprietary models. Ai2 released three variants of Molmo 2: Molmo 2 8B , a Qwen-3–based model that Ai2 describes as its “best overall model for video grounding and QA” Molmo 2 4B , designed for more efficient deployments Molmo 2-O 7B, built on the Olmo model Molmo 2 supports single-image and multi-image inputs, as well as video clips of different lengths, enabling tasks such as video grounding, tracking, and question answering. “One of our core design goals was to close a major gap in open models: grounding,” Ai2 said in its press release. The company first introduced the Molmo family of open multimodal models last year, beginning with images. Ai2 said Molmo 2 surpasses previous versions in accuracy, temporal understanding, and pixel-level grounding, and in some cases performs competitively with larger models such as Google’s Gemini 3. How Molmo 2 compares Despite their smaller size, the Molmo 2 models outperformed Gemini 3 Pro and other open-weight competitors on video tracking benchmarks. Credit: Ai2 For image and multi-image reasoning, Ai2 said Molmo 2 8B “leads all open-weight models, with the 4B variant close behind.” The 8B and 4B models also showed strong performance in the open-weight Elo human preference evaluation, though Ai2 noted that larger proprietary models continue to lead that benchmark overall. But Molmo 2’s biggest gains are in video grounding and video counting, where it outscores similar open-weight models. “These results highlight both progress and remaining headroom — video grounding is still hard, and no model yet reaches 40% accuracy,\" Ai2 said, referring to current benchmarks. Many video models, such as Google's Veo 3.1 and OpenAI's Sora, are typically very large. Molmo 2 targets a different tradeoff: smaller, open models optimized for grounding and analysis rather than video generation.",

      "text": "Today, we're expanding the Gemini 3 model family with the release of Gemini 3 Flash, which offers frontier intelligence built for speed at a fraction of the cost. With this release, we’re making Gemini 3’s next-generation intelligence accessible to everyone across Google products. Last month, we kicked off Gemini 3 with Gemini 3 Pro and Gemini 3 Deep Think mode, and the response has been incredible. Since launch day, we have been processing over 1T tokens per day on our API. We’ve seen you use Gemini 3 to vibe code simulations to learn about complex topics, build and design interactive games and understand all types of multimodal content. With Gemini 3, we introduced frontier performance across complex reasoning, multimodal and vision understanding and agentic and vibe coding tasks. Gemini 3 Flash retains this foundation, combining Gemini 3's Pro-grade reasoning with Flash-level latency, efficiency and cost. It not only enables everyday tasks with improved reasoning, but also is our most impressive model for agentic workflows. Starting today, Gemini 3 Flash is rolling out to millions of people globally:",

      "text": "레벨3 자율주행차 (사진=BAIC) 중국이 레벨3(L3) 자율주행차를 처음으로 정식 양산 대상에 포함하며, 자율주행 기술의 상업적 도입을 본격화했다. 로이터는 16일(현지시간) 중국 공업정보화부(MIIT)가 국영 완성차 업체인 창안자동차와 베이징자동차(BAIC)가 개발한 전기 세단 2종을 L3 자율주행 차량으로 승인했다고 보도했다. 국가 규제 당국이 L3 기능을 갖춘 차량을 공식 자동차 제품으로 인정한 것은 처음이다. 승인된 차량들은 엄격한 조건 아래에서 조건부 자율주행을 수행할 수 있다. 창안자동차의 모델은 충칭 일부 도심 구간에서 시속 50킬로미터(km) 이내로, BAIC의 전기차 브랜드 ‘아크폭스(Arcfox)’ 모델은 베이징의 고속도로나 주요 간선도로에서 최대 시속 80km까지 자율주행이 허용된다. 양사는 지정된 도로를 중심으로 승차 공유 형태의 시범 운행을 진행할 계획이다. 자율주행은 국제 기준에 따라 레벨1부터 레벨5까지 구분되며, L3는 특정 상황에서 운전자의 손과 시선을 도로에서 떼도 되는 ‘조건부 자율주행’ 단계다. 이는 운전자가 항상 조작을 책임지는 레벨2(L2)와 달리, 시스템이 일정 부분 주행 책임을 지는 것이 특징이다. 비상 상황에서는 운전자의 즉각적인 개입이 여전히 요구된다. 이번 결정은 자율주행 기술에서 주도권을 확보하려는 중국 정부의 방향성을 분명히 보여준다. 중국은 지난해 9개 완성차 업체를 선정해 자율주행 공개 테스트를 실시하는 등 단계적으로 제도와 인프라를 정비해 왔다. 올해 3월에는 샤오미 전기 세단 SU7이 보조주행 상태에서 사고를 내 탑승자 3명이 사망하는 사건이 발생하며, 관련 기술에 대한 규제와 안전 심사가 강화되기도 했다. 그럼에도 기술 고도화를 늦추지 않겠다는 입장이다. 특히 L3 자율주행 체제에서는 사고 발생 시 완성차 업체와 부품 공급업체의 책임을 명확히 하겠다는 방침을 세워, 기술 확산과 책임 규제를 동시에 추진하고 있다. 현재 중국 전역에서는 포니닷에이아이와 위라이드 등 자율주행 스타트업들이 지방정부의 허가를 받아 레벨4(L4) 차량을 시험 운행 중이다. 반면, 테슬라의 ‘풀 셀프 드라이빙(FSD)’은 올해 2월 중국에서 일부 기능만 승인받았으며, 여전히 L2 수준에 머물러 미국보다 제약이 크다. 박찬 기자 cpark@aitimes.com",

      "text": "It has become increasingly clear in 2025 that retrieval augmented generation (RAG) isn't enough to meet the growing data requirements for agentic AI. RAG emerged in the last couple of years to become the default approach for connecting LLMs to external knowledge. The pattern is straightforward: chunk documents, embed them into vectors, store them in a database, and retrieve the most similar passages when queries arrive. This works adequately for one-off questions over static documents. But the architecture breaks down when AI agents need to operate across multiple sessions, maintain context over time, or distinguish what they've observed from what they believe. A new open source memory architecture called Hindsight tackles this challenge by organizing AI agent memory into four separate networks that distinguish world facts, agent experiences, synthesized entity summaries, and evolving beliefs. The system, which was developed by Vectorize.io in collaboration with Virginia Tech and The Washington Post, achieved 91.4% accuracy on the LongMemEval benchmark, outperforming existing memory systems. \"RAG is on life support, and agent memory is about to kill it entirely,\" Chris Latimer, co-founder and CEO of Vectorize.io , told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. \"Most of the existing RAG infrastructure that people have put into place is not performing at the level that they would like it to.\" Why RAG can't handle long-term agent memory RAG was originally developed as an approach to give LLMs access to information beyond their training data without retraining the model. The core problem is that RAG treats all retrieved information uniformly. A fact observed six months ago receives the same treatment as an opinion formed yesterday. Information that contradicts earlier statements sits alongside the original claims with no mechanism to reconcile them. The system has no way to represent uncertainty, track how beliefs evolved, or understand why it reached a particular conclusion. The problem becomes acute in multi-session conversations. When an agent needs to recall details from hundreds of thousands of tokens spread across dozens of sessions, RAG systems either flood the context window with irrelevant information or miss critical details entirely. Vector similarity alone cannot determine what matters for a given query when that query requires understanding temporal relationships, causal chains or entity-specific context accumulated over weeks. \"If you have a one-size-fits-all approach to memory, either you're carrying too much context you shouldn't be carrying, or you're carrying too little context,\" Naren Ramakrishnan, professor of computer science at Virginia Tech and director of the Sangani Center for AI and Data Analytics, told VentureBeat. The shift from RAG to agentic memory with Hindsight The shift from RAG to agent memory represents a fundamental architectural change. Instead of treating memory as an external retrieval layer that dumps text chunks into prompts, Hindsight integrates memory as a structured, first-class substrate for reasoning. The core innovation in Hindsight is its separation of knowledge into four logical networks. The world network stores objective facts about the external environment. The bank network captures the agent's own experiences and actions, written in first person. The opinion network maintains subjective judgments with confidence scores that update as new evidence arrives. The observation network holds preference-neutral summaries of entities synthesized from underlying facts. This separation addresses what researchers call \"epistemic clarity\" by structurally distinguishing evidence from inference. When an agent forms an opinion, that belief is stored separately from the facts that support it, along with a confidence score. As new information arrives, the system can strengthen or weaken existing opinions rather than treating all stored information as equally certain. The architecture consists of two components that mimic how human memory works. TEMPR (Temporal Entity Memory Priming Retrieval) handles memory retention and recall by running four parallel searches: semantic vector similarity, keyword matching via BM25, graph traversal through shared entities, and temporal filtering for time-constrained queries. The system merges results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion and applies a neural reranker for final precision. CARA (Coherent Adaptive Reasoning Agents) handles preference-aware reflection by integrating configurable disposition parameters into reasoning: skepticism, literalism, and empathy. This addresses inconsistent reasoning across sessions. Without preference conditioning, agents produce locally plausible but globally inconsistent responses because the underlying LLM has no stable perspective. Hindsight achieves highest LongMemEval score at 91% Hindsight isn't just theoretical academic research; the open-source technology was evaluated on the LongMemEval benchmark. The test evaluates agents on conversations spanning up to 1.5 million tokens across multiple sessions, measuring their ability to recall information, reason across time, and maintain consistent perspectives. The LongMemEval benchmark tests whether AI agents can handle real-world deployment scenarios. One of the key challenges enterprises face is agents that work well in testing but fail in production. Hindsight achieved 91.4% accuracy on the benchmark, the highest score recorded on the test. The broader set of results showed where structured memory provides the biggest gains: multi-session questions improved from 21.1% to 79.7%; temporal reasoning jumped from 31.6% to 79.7%; and knowledge update questions improved from 60.3% to 84.6%. \"It means that your agents will be able to perform more tasks, more accurately and consistently than they could before,\" Latimer said. \"What this allows you to do is to get a more accurate agent that can handle more mission critical business processes.\" Enterprise deployment and hyperscaler integration For enterprises considering how to deploy Hindsight, the implementation path is straightforward. The system runs as a single Docker container and integrates using an LLM wrapper that works with any language model. \"It's a drop-in replacement for your API calls, and you start populating memories immediately,\" Latimer said. The technology targets enterprises that have already deployed RAG infrastructure and are not seeing the performance they need. \"Most of the existing RAG infrastructure that people have put into place is not performing at the level that they would like it to, and they're looking for more robust solutions that can solve the problems that companies have, which is generally the inability to retrieve the correct information to complete a task or to answer a set of questions,\" Latimer said. Vectorize is working with hyperscalers to integrate the technology into cloud platforms. The company is actively partnering with cloud providers to support their LLMs with agent memory capabilities. What this means for enterprises For enterprises leading AI adoption, Hindsight represents a path beyond the limitations of current RAG deployments. Organizations that have invested in retrieval augmented generation and are seeing inconsistent agent performance should evaluate whether structured memory can address their specific failure modes. The technology particularly suits applications where agents must maintain context across multiple sessions, handle contradictory information over time or explain their reasoning \"RAG is dead, and I think agent memory is what's going to kill it completely,\" Latimer said.",

      "text": "Matthias is the co-founder and publisher of THE DECODER, exploring how AI is fundamentally changing the relationship between humans and computers. Content Summary OpenAI says the new GPT-Image 1.5 model follows prompts more accurately, preserves details better, and generates images significantly faster. Ad OpenAI says the new GPT-Image 1.5 model brings several major improvements: more accurate prompt interpretation, better detail preservation, and significantly faster generation times. The new model generates images up to four times faster than before, and users can queue up new images while others are still processing. The model is now live for all ChatGPT users and through the API. OpenAI's app CEO Fidji Simo sees the new image generation as part of a bigger shift: ChatGPT is moving from a reactive, text-based tool toward a \"fully generative UI that brings in the right components based on what you want to do.\" Ad Ad THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. ✓ Weekly ✓ Free ✓ Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty Edits stay more consistent across lighting, composition, and faces The model also handles image editing differently now. It makes targeted changes without messing up other parts of the image, keeping lighting, composition, and faces more consistent compared to its predecessor. OpenAI says it can handle adding, removing, combining, blending, and transposing image elements. Use cases include photo editing, virtual try-ons for clothes and hairstyles, and style transformations. OpenAI's demos show things like combining multiple people and a dog from separate photos into one scene, or turning a photo into a movie poster with a golden age Hollywood look. Share Recommend our article Share The model actually follows complex prompts now The new model is noticeably better at following detailed instructions. In a test with a 6 x 6 grid that needed specific objects in each cell, the new version got the arrangement right, while the old one didn't, OpenAI says. This makes it easier to create images where the placement of elements really matters. Text rendering is noticeably improved as well. The model can now handle denser, smaller text—so you can get legible snippets of articles, short tables, or infographics with numbers. However, OpenAI admits it still struggles with longer stretches of text, unusual fonts, multiple faces in one image, or producing content in different languages. We ran our benchmark prompt that requires a detailed, complex, photorealistic scene with an unusual element: a horse riding an astronaut, something the models definitely haven't seen during training. Older models choked on this. But the latest generation, including Flux 2, does much better. The new Image-1.5 performs on par with Google's Nano Banana Pro, and far better than the previous version. First impressions: the ChatGPT image model produces more intense-looking images compared to Google's Nano Banana Pro. With the same prompt, Nano Banana Pro interprets things more literally and produces a casual photo look rather than a polished photoshoot vibe. That said, this could be a prompting thing. API prices drop 20 percent despite better performance Developers can access the model as GPT Image 1.5 through the API. OpenAI says image inputs and outputs are 20 percent cheaper than the previous model. Pricing sits at 8 dollars per million input tokens and 32 dollars per million output tokens for images. Text tokens cost 5 dollars (input) and 10 dollars (output) per million tokens. With the predecessor model GPT-1, images ran between 0.02 cents and 0.19 cents per image depending on quality settings. OpenAI says the model does a better job preserving brand logos and visual elements, which could matter for marketing and e-commerce use cases. The previous version of ChatGPT image generation is still available as a custom GPT. Ad",

      "text": "기사를 읽어드립니다. (사진=KAIST) 한국과학기술원(KAIST, 총장 이광형)은 김준모 전기및전자공학부 교수 연구팀이 인간 선호를 반영, 데이터 효율성과 학습 안정성을 향상한 새로운 강화 학습(RL) 프레임워크 ‘ TVKD(Teacher Value-based Knowledge Distillation) ’를 개발했다고 17일 밝혔다. 기존 AI 학습 방식은 “A가 B보다 낫다”라는 식의 ‘단순 비교’ 데이터를 대량으로 수집해 학습하는 구조였다고 설명했다. 하지만, 이 방식은 많은 데이터가 필요할 뿐만 아니라, 판단이 애매한 상황에서는 AI가 혼란에 빠지기 쉽다는 한계가 있었다고 지적했다. 연구팀은 이 문제를 해결하기 위해, 사람 선호를 깊이 이해한 ‘교사 모델’이 핵심 정보만을 ‘학생 모델’에게 전달하는 RL 방식을 제안했다. 복잡한 내용을 정리해 가르치는 가정교사에 비유할 수 있으며, 이를 ‘선호 증류(Preference Distillation)’라고 명명했다. 핵심 기술은 ▲문맥 전체를 고려한 가치 판단 학습과 ▲선호 데이터의 신뢰도에 따라 학습 중요도를 조절하는 기법이라고 전했다. 특히, 기존처럼 단순히 좋다/나쁘다를 흉내내는 것이 아니라고 강조했다. 각 상황이 얼마나 가치 있는지 수치적으로 판단하는 ‘가치 함수’를 교사 모델이 학습한 뒤 이를 학생 모델에 전달하도록 설계했다. AI는 애매한 상황 속에서도 단편적 비교가 아닌 ‘종합적인 판단’을 내릴 수 있게 된다는 설명이다. 선호 증류 성능 비교 결과 (사진=arXiv) 이 기술을 여러 AI 모델에 적용해 실험한 결과, 기존 방법보다 더 정확하고 안정적인 성능을 보였다고 전했다. 특히, 'MT-벤치' '알파카-이밸(AlpacaEval)' 등 주요 평가 지표에서 기존 최고 기술을 앞섰다고 밝혔다. 김준모 KAIST 교수는 “현실에서는 사람의 선호 데이터가 항상 충분하거나 완벽하지 않다”라며 “이번 기술은 제한적 환경 속에서도 AI의 일관적 학습을 도와주기 때문에, 다양한 분야에서 실용성이 높을 것으로 전망한다”라고 말했다. 한편, 이번 연구 성과는 ‘뉴립스(NeurIPS) 2025’에 채택됐다. 장세민 기자 semim99@aitimes.com",

      "text": "As enterprises accelerate the deployment of LLMs and agentic workflows, they are hitting a critical infrastructure bottleneck: the container base images powering these applications are riddled with inherited security debt. Echo, an Israeli startup, is announcing a $35 million in Series A funding today (bringing its to-date total to $50 million in funding) to fix this by fundamentally reimagining how cloud infrastructure is built. The round was led by N47, with participation from Notable Capital, Hyperwise Ventures, and SentinelOne. But the real story isn't the capital—it's the company’s ambitious goal to replace the chaotic open-source supply chain with a managed, \"secure-by-design\" operating system. The Hidden Operating System of the Cloud To understand why Echo matters, you first have to understand the invisible foundation of the modern internet: container base images. Think of a \"container\" like a shipping box for software. It holds the application code (what the developers write) and everything that code needs to run (the \"base image\"). For a non-technical audience, the best way to understand a base image is to compare it to a brand-new laptop. When you buy a computer, it comes with an Operating System (OS) like Windows or macOS pre-installed to handle the basics—talking to the hard drive, connecting to Wi-Fi, and running programs. Without it, the computer is useless. In the cloud, the base image is that Operating System. Whether a company like Netflix or Uber is building a simple web app or a complex network of autonomous AI agents, they rely on these pre-built layers (like Alpine, Python, or Node.js) to define the underlying runtimes and dependencies. Here is where the risk begins. Unlike Windows or macOS, which are maintained by tech giants, most base images are open-source and created by communities of volunteers. Because they are designed to be useful to everyone, they are often packed with \"bloat\"—hundreds of extra tools and settings that most companies don't actually need. Eylam Milner, Echo’s CTO, uses a stark analogy to explain why this is dangerous: \"Taking software just from the open source world, it's like taking a computer found on the sidewalk and plugging it into your [network].\" Traditionally, companies try to fix this by downloading the image, scanning it for bugs, and attempting to \"patch\" the holes. But it is a losing battle. Echo’s research indicates that official Docker images often contain over 1,000 known vulnerabilities (CVEs) the moment they are downloaded. For enterprise security teams, this creates an impossible game of \"whac-a-mole,\" inheriting infrastructure debt before their engineers write a single line of code. The \"Enterprise Linux\" Moment for AI For Eilon Elhadad, Echo’s co-founder and CEO, the industry is repeating history. \"Exactly what's happened in the past... everybody run with Linux, and then they move to Enterprise Linux,\" Elhadad told VentureBeat. Just as Red Hat professionalized open-source Linux for the corporate world, Echo aims to be the \"enterprise AI native OS\"—a hardened, curated foundation for the AI era. \"We see ourselves in the AI native era, the foundation of everything,\" says Elhadad. The Tech: A \"Software Compilation Factory\" Echo is not a scanning tool. It does not look for vulnerabilities after the fact. Instead, it operates as a \"software compilation factory\" that rebuilds images from scratch. According to Milner, Echo’s approach to eliminating vulnerabilities relies on a rigorous, two-step engineering process for every workload: Compilation from Source: Echo starts with an empty canvas. It does not patch existing bloated images; it compiles binaries and libraries directly from source code. This ensures that only essential components are included, drastically reducing the attack surface. Hardening & Provenance (SLSA Level 3): The resulting images are hardened with aggressive security configurations to make exploitation difficult. Crucially, the build pipeline adheres to SLSA Level 3 standards (Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts), ensuring that every artifact is signed, tested, and verifiable. The result is a \"drop-in replacement.\" A developer simply changes one line in their Dockerfile to point to Echo’s registry. The application runs identically, but the underlying OS layer is mathematically cleaner and free of known CVEs. AI Defending Against AI The need for this level of hygiene is being driven by the \"AI vs. AI\" security arms race. Bad actors are increasingly using AI to compress exploit windows from weeks down to days. Simultaneously, \"coding agents\"—AI tools that autonomously write software—are becoming the number one generators of code, often statistically selecting outdated or vulnerable libraries from open source. To counter this, Echo has built a proprietary infrastructure of AI agents that autonomously manage vulnerability research. Continuous Monitoring: Echo’s agents monitor the 4,000+ new CVEs added to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) monthly. Unstructured Research : Beyond official databases, these agents scour unstructured sources like GitHub comments and developer forums to identify patches before they are widely published. Self-Healing: When a vulnerability is confirmed, the agents identify affected images, apply the fix, run compatibility tests, and generate a pull request for human review. This automation allows Echo’s engineering team to maintain over 600 secure images—a scale that would traditionally require hundreds of security researchers. Why It Matters to the CISO For technical decision-makers, Echo represents a shift from \"mean time to remediation\" to \"zero vulnerabilities by default.\" Dan Garcia, CISO of EDB, noted in a press release that the platform \"saves at least 235 developer hours per release\" by eliminating the need for engineers to investigate false positives or patch base images manually. Echo is already securing production workloads for major enterprises like UiPath, EDB, and Varonis. As enterprises move from containers to agentic workflows, the ability to trust the underlying infrastructure—without managing it—may be the defining characteristic of the next generation of DevSecOps. Pricing for Echo's solution is not publicly listed, but the company says on its website it prices \"based on image consumption, to ensure it scales with how you actually build and ship software.\"",

      "text": "Matthias is the co-founder and publisher of THE DECODER, exploring how AI is fundamentally changing the relationship between humans and computers. Content Summary People have been trained to expect that faster means better. With AI, the opposite is often true. OpenAI is now rolling back its GPT-5 router. But the company should be educating users instead. Ad OpenAI has quietly removed a core ChatGPT feature from hundreds of millions of users, according to WIRED. The model router, which automatically directed queries to the right AI model, is no longer available to free users or those on the $5 subscription. These users will now get responses from GPT-5.2 Instant by default—the fastest and cheapest model in the new series. The move exposes a fundamental tension in the AI industry: the most powerful reasoning models are slow, often taking several minutes before answering, and most users don't want to wait. That's likely why OpenAI already added an \"Answer now\" button that cuts off the model's thinking process for an immediate response. This only really makes sense for engagement metrics. Anyone who wants quality answers should skip that button entirely. Share Recommend our article Share Users choose speed over smarter answers OpenAI launched the model router just four months ago alongside GPT-5. The system analyzed incoming queries and automatically picked whether to use a fast, cheap model or a slower but more capable reasoning model. The router was supposed to replace the increasingly cluttered model selection menu and always serve users the best option. Ad Ad THE DECODER Newsletter The most important AI news straight to your inbox. ✓ Weekly ✓ Free ✓ Cancel at any time Please leave this field empty Most users don't even know that different AI models exist with different capabilities. And even those who do often can't tell which model fits which type of question. A router could cut through that complexity - something OpenAI had explicitly aimed for when designing GPT-5. But the experiment didn't pan out. According to a source familiar with the situation, the router hurt daily active user numbers because reasoning models can take minutes to work through complex questions. Daily active users is a key success metric for OpenAI. Routing to better models proved expensive There's another factor at play: routing more queries to expensive models costs OpenAI money, and the AI company is already burning through cash at a staggering rate. Shortly after launch, Altman said the router had boosted reasoning model usage among free users from under one percent to seven percent, and from seven percent to 24 percent for Plus subscribers. OpenAI told WIRED that user feedback showed free and Go subscribers prefer the standard chat experience. Reasoning models are still available but require manual selection. The router stays active for paying Plus and Pro subscribers. OpenAI says it may bring the feature back for free users once the technology improves. The rollback also removes a safety feature: the router had been forwarding signs of psychological distress to models designed to handle those situations. OpenAI says GPT-5.2 Instant now scores better on safety benchmarks, justifying the change. Ad",

      "text": "Mistral AI, the French artificial intelligence company valued at €11.7 billion, unveiled its third-generation optical character recognition model on Tuesday, positioning document digitization as the critical first step enterprises must take before realizing the full potential of generative AI. The new model, called Mistral OCR 3, claims a 74% win rate against competing products when processing forms, scanned documents, complex tables, and handwritten content. Mistral priced the technology aggressively at $2 per 1,000 pages — with a 50% discount for batch processing — dramatically undercutting many established enterprise document processing solutions. The release arrives at a pivotal moment for the two-year-old startup. Mistral has spent December on an aggressive product offensive, launching its Mistral 3 family of open-weight models, new coding tools called Devstral 2, and now OCR 3. The company faces intensifying pressure from American rivals flush with capital — OpenAI recently sold secondary shares at a reported $500 billion valuation, while Anthropic raised $13 billion in September — and potential regulatory friction as the Trump administration threatens retaliation against European companies over EU technology laws. Why enterprises can't adopt AI until they solve their paper problem Marjorie Janiewicz, Mistral's Chief Revenue Officer who oversees global revenue including solutions architecture and forward deployment engineering, framed the OCR release as a direct response to patterns the company observed while helping enterprises deploy AI over the past year. \"A lot of very large enterprises are still sitting on a very large volume of critical data that's not digitized yet,\" Janiewicz said in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"That data that's not digitized represents a massive competitive moat.\" The observation cuts to the heart of a widely documented problem in enterprise AI adoption. Despite billions invested in AI initiatives, most organizations struggle to move beyond proof-of-concept projects into production systems that generate measurable returns. Research consistently shows a significant gap between AI experimentation and real business value. Janiewicz argued that document digitization creates two distinct opportunities. First, it unlocks institutional knowledge accumulated over decades — proprietary data that could power personalized AI systems and agents. Second, it enables the workflow automation that promises to transform day-to-day operations but remains stalled in document-heavy industries. \"When you think about workflow transformation, a lot of enterprises today could benefit from really transformational workflow automation if the data that was core to their business was fully digitized,\" Janiewicz explained. From anti-money laundering to insurance claims, how OCR transforms regulated industries Mistral designed OCR 3 to excel across the regulated, document-intensive industries where AI adoption has proven most challenging — and where the stakes for accuracy are highest. In financial services, Janiewicz pointed to anti-money laundering compliance and know-your-customer processes, where banks process millions of documents annually to meet regulatory requirements. \"When you think about opening a bank account, or a lot of the tasks that are still being done in retail banks, it's on paper,\" she said. \"When you start correlating that to anti-money laundering workflow automation processes, or KYC as a customer support process, where governance and being able to inspect things is so essential — a lot of the banks are talking to us about the need to accelerate the pace, the accuracy and the performance of the digitization process.\" The insurance industry presents similar challenges. Claim management workflows require connecting photographs of vehicle damage, handwritten accident reports, and policy documentation to automated processing engines. Healthcare organizations grapple with admission forms, medical histories, prescription records, and consent documentation scattered across paper and digital formats. Manufacturing drew particular enthusiasm from Janiewicz. \"I love manufacturing as an industry,\" she said. \"When you start thinking about the very complex technical documents, many of those documents are either not digitized yet, or they are so complex that extracting valuable information from them to accelerate the manufacturing process, or even innovation, is a challenge.\" Mistral claims major accuracy gains on handwriting, complex tables, and damaged scans According to Mistral's benchmarks, OCR 3 demonstrates significant improvements over its predecessor across several categories that have historically challenged optical character recognition systems. The model interprets cursive handwriting, mixed-content annotations, and handwritten text layered over printed forms — scenarios that frequently produce errors in traditional OCR systems. It reconstructs complex table structures with headers, merged cells, multi-row blocks, and column hierarchies, outputting HTML table tags that preserve layout for downstream processing. Perhaps most notably for organizations dealing with legacy documents, Mistral claims substantial improvements in handling the artifacts that plague real-world document processing: compression artifacts, skew, distortion, low resolution, and background noise. Tim Law, IDC's Director of Research for AI and Automation, underscored the strategic importance of the technology. \"OCR remains foundational for enabling generative AI and agentic AI,\" Law said. \"Those organizations that can efficiently and cost-effectively extract text and embedded images with high fidelity will unlock value and will gain a competitive advantage from their data by providing richer context.\" When asked what prevents well-funded competitors from replicating Mistral's approach within months, Janiewicz emphasized the accuracy gap that has frustrated enterprise deployments. \"Enterprises have two and a half years of history with competitive OCR solutions, and the reason we think this is a real advantage for us is accuracy,\" she said. \"Many enterprises are complaining about the accuracy of those systems, which has slowed their ability to digitize their documents.\" How Mistral AI Studio creates a complete document-to-production pipeline Beyond raw model performance, Mistral positioned OCR 3 as part of a vertically integrated stack designed for complex enterprise deployments. The model operates within Document AI, a component of Mistral AI Studio that the company introduced in October as its production platform for enterprise AI development. Mistral AI Studio provides observability, agent runtime capabilities, and an AI registry — infrastructure Janiewicz described as essential for moving AI from experimentation to reliable production systems. OCR 3 feeds directly into this ecosystem, connecting document processing to the company's broader model offerings and workflow tools. \"It's the vertical integration of OCR, the models, and Studio, coupled with accuracy, that I think is creating a very differentiated play,\" Janiewicz said. \"Most companies today are struggling with off-the-shelf solutions not being good enough to help them transform a complex workflow.\" The release supports deployment across cloud, virtual private cloud, and on-premises environments — flexibility that matters enormously for regulated industries where data sovereignty and security concerns dictate infrastructure decisions. Keeping enterprise data 'home' in an era of AI security concerns For financial services, healthcare, and other heavily regulated industries, questions about data handling during AI processing carry significant weight. Janiewicz addressed these concerns directly. \"Many times the models are going to be used on their own GPUs,\" she said, referring to on-premises and VPC deployments. \"That's a great way to make sure companies feel that the data is home — it's not going to be exposed to anyone else.\" On the sensitive question of training data, Janiewicz was unequivocal: \"For all our training, we never use our customers' data to train.\" The company announced a partnership with HSBC in recent weeks to build productivity tools for the multinational bank — a significant validation of Mistral's enterprise security posture in one of the world's most demanding regulatory environments. Mistral's December product blitz signals an aggressive push against OpenAI and Anthropic The OCR 3 release extends Mistral's December product blitz, which began when the company launched its Mistral 3 family of open-weight models on December 2. That release included Mistral Large 3, a frontier model with multimodal and multilingual capabilities, alongside nine smaller Ministral 3 models designed for edge deployment on devices with limited connectivity. The company followed up a week later with Devstral 2, a new generation of coding models, and Mistral Vibe, a command-line interface for code automation through natural language — a direct play for the \"vibe coding\" market that has fueled the rise of companies like Cursor. These releases build on substantial infrastructure partnerships. Microsoft distributes Mistral models through Azure Foundry, with OCR 3 expected to become available on the platform. Amazon Web Services added Mistral Large 3 and Ministral 3 models to Amazon Bedrock in early December, providing fully managed access alongside models from Google, OpenAI, and others. Mistral's roughly $2 billion (€1.7 billion) Series C round in September, led by Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML with participation from NVIDIA, DST Global, and Andreessen Horowitz, gave the company resources to accelerate development. But the funding pales against American competitors — OpenAI sold secondary shares in October at a $500 billion valuation, making it the world's most valuable private company, while Anthropic reached a $350 billion valuation in November following investments from Microsoft and Nvidia. Guillaume Lample, Mistral's co-founder and chief scientist, has argued that bigger isn't always better for enterprise use cases. \"In practice, the huge majority of enterprise use cases are things that can be tackled by small models, especially if you fine-tune them,\" Lample said in a recent interview with TechCrunch. Janiewicz echoed this philosophy. \"The biggest learning over the past 12 months is that off-the-shelf AI is not cutting it in driving real value for the enterprise in production,\" she said. \"Customization of the models, customization of the technology, giving control back to enterprises to build their own AI solutions — that's absolutely paramount.\" US-EU technology tensions create new risks for European AI companies Mistral's aggressive expansion comes as European technology companies face potential regulatory retaliation from the United States. The Trump administration warned last week that it would use \"every tool at its disposal\" if the European Union continued enforcing its technology laws, putting companies including Mistral, Spotify, Siemens, and Publicis in a precarious position. The European Commission responded that its rules \"apply equally and fairly to all companies operating in the EU,\" but the standoff introduces uncertainty for European AI companies seeking American enterprise customers. Mistral has differentiated itself from Chinese competitors like DeepSeek and Alibaba's Qwen by emphasizing its Apache 2.0 licensing and worldwide availability without regional restrictions — a positioning that takes on added significance amid escalating technology tensions between major economic blocs. Aggressive pricing suggests Mistral sees OCR as a gateway to deeper enterprise relationships Janiewicz outlined three revenue pillars for Mistral: complex workflow transformation using Mistral Studio and forward deployment engineering; research and development partnerships to co-build specialized models; and productivity tools including the Le Chat assistant and Mistral Code for developers. Document AI and OCR fit into the first pillar while potentially serving as an entry point that leads customers into deeper engagements. \"OCR is a great way to get those enterprises started and being able to start showing some concrete results,\" Janiewicz said. The aggressive pricing — significantly below many enterprise document processing alternatives — suggests Mistral views OCR as a wedge product rather than a primary profit center. Early customers use the technology to process invoices into structured fields, digitize corporate archives, extract clean text from technical and scientific reports, and improve enterprise search. The company also highlighted accessibility applications. AI-powered OCR can transform printed, handwritten, or scanned documents into searchable digital formats compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies — a capability with implications for compliance with disability access requirements in education and government. The unsexy problem that could determine who wins the enterprise AI race Mistral's OCR 3 is a calculated wager that the path to enterprise AI dominance runs not through ever-larger language models, but through the unglamorous work of converting paper into data. While competitors race to build more powerful chatbots and autonomous agents, the French startup is betting that enterprises can't use any of those tools until they first digitize the institutional knowledge buried in filing cabinets and PDF archives. \"For us, OCR is a great way to get those enterprises started and being able to start showing some concrete results,\" Janiewicz said. \"To us, really, the key message is customization, portability, and control is the secret sauce to ROI.\" The model becomes available Tuesday through Mistral's API and the Document AI interface in Mistral AI Studio. Developers can access it using the identifier mistral-ocr-2512.",

      "text": "기사를 읽어드립니다. (사진=셔터스톡) 오픈AI가 아마존과 100억달러(약 14조8000억원) 규모의 투자 유치에 대해 논의 중인 것으로 알려졌다. 여기에는 아마존의 클라우드 서비스와 자체 개발 AI 칩, 그리고 전자상거래 등 다양한 파트너십이 포함된 것으로 전해졌다. 디 인포메이션은 16일(현지시간) 복수의 소식통을 인용, 아마존이 오픈AI와 5000억달러(약 740조원)를 상회하는 기업 가치를 기준으로 100억달러 투자를 논의 중이라고 보도했다 이에 따르면, 이번 협상이 타결되면 오픈AI는 아마존 웹 서비스(AWS)로부터 서버를 임대하는 데 드는 비용 충당에 도움이 될 수 있다. 오픈AI는 지난달 AWS로부터 서버를 임대하는 데 7년간 380억달러를 지출할 것이라고 발표한 바 있다. 당시에는 엔비디아 칩을 활용한다는 내용이었다. 그러나 이번에는 아마존이 개발한 '트레이니엄(Trainium)' 사용이 포함됐다. 그동안 아마존은 마이크로소프트(MS)와 구글에 비해 AI 클라우드 사업에 뒤처진다는 평을 받았는데, 이번 거래가 성사되면 칩 임대 사업에 큰 도움이 될 수 있다. 앞서 아마존은 지난 10월 앤트로픽과의 계약을 통해 '트레이니엄 2' 100만장을 탑재한 데이터센터 '프로젝트 레이니어(Project Rainier)’를 가동한다고 밝힌 바 있다. 이 상황에서 오픈AI까지 가세하면, 엄청난 홍보가 될 수 있다. 하지만, 이번 계약에는 아마존의 '베드록(Bedrock)' 서비스를 통해 오픈AI 모델을 제공하는 것은 포함되지 않는다. 이는 MS가 여전히 독점권을 가지고 있기 때문이다. 또 두 회사는 상거래 파트너십에 대해서도 논의한 것으로 밝혀졌다. 소식통에 따르면, 오픈AI는 '챗GPT'에 타사 앱을 포함하는 기능을 통해 월마트와 쇼피파이, 인스타카트 등 전자 상거래 기업을 잇달아 유치했다. 세게 최대의 온라인 마켓인 아마존이 합류하면 큰 힘을 받게 된다. 구체적으로 어떤 형태로 협력이 진행될지는 알려진 바 없다. 여기에 오픈AI는 아마존에 '챗GPT 엔터프라이즈'를 판매할 계획도 있는 것으로 전해졌다. 이번 논의는 오픈AI가 기업 구조변경을 완료한 10월경 시작됐으며, 조건은 변경될 수 있는 것으로 전해졌다. 또 아마존 투자 유치를 시작으로 오픈AI가 새로운 대규모 펀딩 라운드에 나설 가능성도 거론됐다. 이번 거래가 성사되면 아마존은 엔비디아와 AMD에 이어 오픈AI에 투자하는 AI 칩 제조사 중 하나가 된다. 한편, 아마존은 2023년부터 앤트로픽에 집중 투자하며 파트너십을 확장해 왔다. 그동안 80억달러를 투자했으며, 추가 투자도 검토 중인 것으로 알려졌다. 이처럼 칩 제조사와 클라우드 공급자, AI 기업 등은 이제 복잡한 협력 관계를 이루게 됐다. 임대준 기자 ydj@aitimes.com",

      "text": "Jonathan writes for THE DECODER about how AI tools can improve both work and creative projects. Google is linking its NotebookLM research tool directly to the Gemini chatbot. This integration lets users select specific notebooks as context for their Gemini queries, effectively expanding the chatbot's knowledge base beyond its initial training data and standard web results. While NotebookLM already includes a built-in chat function powered by a Gemini model, it remains quite limited—it doesn't even save chat histories. The new feature addresses this by allowing users to leverage multiple notebooks simultaneously within the main Gemini interface. It also supports integration with \"Gems,\" the personalized versions of the chatbot. The rollout appears to be gradual, starting with browser users, though app support will likely follow soon. Ad NotebookLM started as an experimental tool in 2023. It has since established itself as a software with exemplary AI integration, particularly in the education sector. The tool makes it easy to set up RAG environments and thus make large document collections analyzable and searchable. Google regularly adds new functions to NotebookLM, most recently including one for deep research. Ad",

      "text": "기사를 읽어드립니다. 구글이 이메일을 통해 하루 일정을 정리해 주는 실험적 AI 비서를 선보이며, 개인화와 생산성 강화에 나섰다. 구글은 16일(현지시간) 구글 랩스(Google Labs)를 통해 새로운 AI 에이전트 ‘CC’를 공개했다. CC는 '제미나이'를 활용하며, 사용자의 지메일, 구글 드라이브, 구글 캘린더와 연동해 매일 아침 이메일 형태의 개인화된 요약 브리핑을 제공한다. 이와 같은 ‘오늘의 일정(Your Day Ahead)’ 이메일은 하루 동안의 일정과 해야 할 업무를 정리해 보여주고, 이메일·문서·캘린더에서 놓치기 쉬운 주요 업데이트를 한눈에 요약해 준다. 예를 들어 준비가 필요한 미팅, 처리해야 할 청구서, 일정 변경 사항 등을 사전에 알려주며, 즉시 행동할 수 있도록 이메일 초안이나 캘린더 링크를 동시에 제안한다. CC는 단순한 요약 도구에 그치지 않는다. 사용자는 CC가 보낸 이메일에 직접 답장하거나, 별도로 CC에게 이메일을 보내 할 일 추가, 개인 선호도 학습, 메모 저장, 정보 검색 등을 요청할 수 있다. 이를 통해 CC는 사용자의 업무 패턴과 취향을 점차 학습하며, 보다 정교하고 맞춤화된 브리핑을 제공하게 된다. CC의 예 (사진=구글) 현재 CC는 미국과 캐나다의 만 18세 이상 사용자 가운데 AI 프로(Pro) 및 울트라(Ultra) 유료 구독자를 대상으로 얼리 액세스 형태로 제공된다. 기업용 구글 워크스페이스 계정은 지원하지 않으며, 개인 소비자 계정에서만 이용할 수 있다. 구글은 대기자 명단을 열었지만, 정식 출시나 지원 국가 확대 시점은 아직 공개하지 않았다. 이메일 기반 AI 브리핑이라는 점에서 CC는 오픈AI가 지난 9월 선보인 개인화 브리핑 도구 ‘챗GPT 펄스(Pulse)’와도 유사하다. 당시 샘 알트먼 오픈AI CEO는 펄스를 “최근 출시한 기능 중 가장 마음에 드는 기능”이라고 평한 바 있다. 이와 비슷한 시도는 다른 스타트업에서도 이어지고 있다. 회의 기록 서비스인 리드 AI(Read AI)와 파이어플라이즈(Fireflies)는 일일 요약 브리핑을 제공하고 있으며, 민디(Mindy)는 이메일 비서로 출발해 크리에이터와 마케팅 분야로 영역을 확장했다. 다만, 이들 서비스는 이메일과 드라이브 전체 맥락까지 폭넓게 활용하지는 못한다는 한계가 있다. 전 구글 노트북LM 개발자들이 만든 오디오 앱 ‘헉스(Huxe)’는 이메일·캘린더·뉴스 선호도를 바탕으로 하루 요약을 팟캐스트 형태로 들려주는 방식을 택했다. 메타도 페이스북 내 사용자 콘텐츠와 외부 정보를 분석해 매일 아침 맞춤형 정보를 정리해 주는 ‘프로젝트 루나(Project Luna)’ 기능을 개발 중이다. 전문가들은 CC를 두고 “구글이 사용자의 하루를 AI와 함께 시작하도록 만들려는 전략적 시도”라고 평가했다. 검색, 이메일, 캘린더, 문서 등 방대한 개인 데이터를 보유한 구글이 이를 하나의 AI 에이전트로 통합하면서, 생산성 도구의 중심을 단순 챗봇에서 일상 브리핑형 AI로 확장하려는 움직임이라는 분석이다. 특히 CC를 별도 앱이나 챗봇이 아닌, 매일 아침 사용자가 가장 먼저 확인하는 이메일을 채널로 삼은 것은, AI 비서를 사용자의 일상 업무 루틴에 가장 낮은 저항으로 침투시키려는 전략으로 해석할 수 있다. 박찬 기자 cpark@aitimes.com",

      "text": "Zoom Video Communications, the company best known for keeping remote workers connected during the pandemic, announced last week that it had achieved the highest score ever recorded on one of artificial intelligence's most demanding tests — a claim that sent ripples of surprise, skepticism, and genuine curiosity through the technology industry. The San Jose-based company said its AI system scored 48.1 percent on the Humanity's Last Exam, a benchmark designed by subject-matter experts worldwide to stump even the most advanced AI models. That result edges out Google's Gemini 3 Pro, which held the previous record at 45.8 percent. \"Zoom has achieved a new state-of-the-art result on the challenging Humanity's Last Exam full-set benchmark, scoring 48.1%, which represents a substantial 2.3% improvement over the previous SOTA result,\" wrote Xuedong Huang, Zoom's chief technology officer, in a blog post. The announcement raises a provocative question that has consumed AI watchers for days: How did a video conferencing company — one with no public history of training large language models — suddenly vault past Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic on a benchmark built to measure the frontiers of machine intelligence? The answer reveals as much about where AI is headed as it does about Zoom's own technical ambitions. And depending on whom you ask, it's either an ingenious demonstration of practical engineering or a hollow claim that appropriates credit for others' work. How Zoom built an AI traffic controller instead of training its own model Zoom did not train its own large language model. Instead, the company developed what it calls a \"federated AI approach\" — a system that routes queries to multiple existing models from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, then uses proprietary software to select, combine, and refine their outputs. At the heart of this system sits what Zoom calls its \"Z-scorer,\" a mechanism that evaluates responses from different models and chooses the best one for any given task. The company pairs this with what it describes as an \"explore-verify-federate strategy,\" an agentic workflow that balances exploratory reasoning with verification across multiple AI systems. \"Our federated approach combines Zoom's own small language models with advanced open-source and closed-source models,\" Huang wrote. The framework \"orchestrates diverse models to generate, challenge, and refine reasoning through dialectical collaboration.\" In simpler terms: Zoom built a sophisticated traffic controller for AI, not the AI itself. This distinction matters enormously in an industry where bragging rights — and billions in valuation — often hinge on who can claim the most capable model. The major AI laboratories spend hundreds of millions of dollars training frontier systems on vast computing clusters. Zoom's achievement, by contrast, appears to rest on clever integration of those existing systems. Why AI researchers are divided over what counts as real innovation The response from the AI community was swift and sharply divided. Max Rumpf, an AI engineer who says he has trained state-of-the-art language models, posted a pointed critique on social media. \"Zoom strung together API calls to Gemini, GPT, Claude et al. and slightly improved on a benchmark that delivers no value for their customers,\" he wrote. \"They then claim SOTA.\" Rumpf did not dismiss the technical approach itself. Using multiple models for different tasks, he noted, is \"actually quite smart and most applications should do this.\" He pointed to Sierra, an AI customer service company, as an example of this multi-model strategy executed effectively. His objection was more specific: \"They did not train the model, but obfuscate this fact in the tweet. The injustice of taking credit for the work of others sits deeply with people.\" But other observers saw the achievement differently. Hongcheng Zhu, a developer, offered a more measured assessment: \"To top an AI eval, you will most likely need model federation, like what Zoom did. An analogy is that every Kaggle competitor knows you have to ensemble models to win a contest.\" The comparison to Kaggle — the competitive data science platform where combining multiple models is standard practice among winning teams — reframes Zoom's approach as industry best practice rather than sleight of hand. Academic research has long established that ensemble methods routinely outperform individual models. Still, the debate exposed a fault line in how the industry understands progress. Ryan Pream, founder of Exoria AI, was dismissive: \"Zoom are just creating a harness around another LLM and reporting that. It is just noise.\" Another commenter captured the sheer unexpectedness of the news: \"That the video conferencing app ZOOM developed a SOTA model that achieved 48% HLE was not on my bingo card.\" Perhaps the most pointed critique concerned priorities. Rumpf argued that Zoom could have directed its resources toward problems its customers actually face. \"Retrieval over call transcripts is not 'solved' by SOTA LLMs,\" he wrote. \"I figure Zoom's users would care about this much more than HLE.\" The Microsoft veteran betting his reputation on a different kind of AI If Zoom's benchmark result seemed to come from nowhere, its chief technology officer did not. Xuedong Huang joined Zoom from Microsoft, where he spent decades building the company's AI capabilities. He founded Microsoft's speech technology group in 1993 and led teams that achieved what the company described as human parity in speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding, and computer vision. Huang holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as a fellow of both the IEEE and the ACM. His credentials place him among the most accomplished AI executives in the industry. His presence at Zoom signals that the company's AI ambitions are serious, even if its methods differ from the research laboratories that dominate headlines. In his tweet celebrating the benchmark result, Huang framed the achievement as validation of Zoom's strategy: \"We have unlocked stronger capabilities in exploration, reasoning, and multi-model collaboration, surpassing the performance limits of any single model.\" That final clause — \"surpassing the performance limits of any single model\" — may be the most significant. Huang is not claiming Zoom built a better model. He is claiming Zoom built a better system for using models. Inside the test designed to stump the world's smartest machines The benchmark at the center of this controversy, Humanity's Last Exam, was designed to be exceptionally difficult. Unlike earlier tests that AI systems learned to game through pattern matching, HLE presents problems that require genuine understanding, multi-step reasoning, and the synthesis of information across complex domains. The exam draws on questions from experts around the world, spanning fields from advanced mathematics to philosophy to specialized scientific knowledge. A score of 48.1 percent might sound unimpressive to anyone accustomed to school grading curves, but in the context of HLE, it represents the current ceiling of machine performance. \"This benchmark was developed by subject-matter experts globally and has become a crucial metric for measuring AI's progress toward human-level performance on challenging intellectual tasks,\" Zoom’s announcement noted. The company's improvement of 2.3 percentage points over Google's previous best may appear modest in isolation. But in competitive benchmarking, where gains often come in fractions of a percent, such a jump commands attention. What Zoom's approach reveals about the future of enterprise AI Zoom's approach carries implications that extend well beyond benchmark leaderboards. The company is signaling a vision for enterprise AI that differs fundamentally from the model-centric strategies pursued by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Rather than betting everything on building the single most capable model, Zoom is positioning itself as an orchestration layer — a company that can integrate the best capabilities from multiple providers and deliver them through products that businesses already use every day. This strategy hedges against a critical uncertainty in the AI market: no one knows which model will be best next month, let alone next year. By building infrastructure that can swap between providers, Zoom avoids vendor lock-in while theoretically offering customers the best available AI for any given task. The announcement of OpenAI's GPT-5.2 the following day underscored this dynamic. OpenAI's own communications named Zoom as a partner that had evaluated the new model's performance \"across their AI workloads and saw measurable gains across the board.\" Zoom, in other words, is both a customer of the frontier labs and now a competitor on their benchmarks — using their own technology. This arrangement may prove sustainable. The major model providers have every incentive to sell API access widely, even to companies that might aggregate their outputs. The more interesting question is whether Zoom's orchestration capabilities constitute genuine intellectual property or merely sophisticated prompt engineering that others could replicate. The real test arrives when Zoom's 300 million users start asking questions Zoom titled its announcement section on industry relations \"A Collaborative Future,\" and Huang struck notes of gratitude throughout. \"The future of AI is collaborative, not competitive,\" he wrote. \"By combining the best innovations from across the industry with our own research breakthroughs, we create solutions that are greater than the sum of their parts.\" This framing positions Zoom as a beneficent integrator, bringing together the industry's best work for the benefit of enterprise customers. Critics see something else: a company claiming the prestige of an AI laboratory without doing the foundational research that earns it. The debate will likely be settled not by leaderboards but by products. When AI Companion 3.0 reaches Zoom's hundreds of millions of users in the coming months, they will render their own verdict — not on benchmarks they have never heard of, but on whether the meeting summary actually captured what mattered, whether the action items made sense, whether the AI saved them time or wasted it. In the end, Zoom's most provocative claim may not be that it topped a benchmark. It may be the implicit argument that in the age of AI, the best model is not the one you build — it's the one you know how to use.",

      "text": "Zencoder, the Silicon Valley startup that builds AI-powered coding agents, released a free desktop application on Monday that it says will fundamentally change how software engineers interact with artificial intelligence — moving the industry beyond the freewheeling era of \"vibe coding\" toward a more disciplined, verifiable approach to AI-assisted development. The product, called Zenflow, introduces what the company describes as an \"AI orchestration layer\" that coordinates multiple AI agents to plan, implement, test, and review code in structured workflows. The launch is Zencoder's most ambitious attempt yet to differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded market dominated by tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and coding agents built directly by AI giants Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. \"Chat UIs were fine for copilots, but they break down when you try to scale,\" said Andrew Filev, Zencoder's chief executive, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"Teams are hitting a wall where speed without structure creates technical debt. Zenflow replaces 'Prompt Roulette' with an engineering assembly line where agents plan, implement, and, crucially, verify each other's work.\" The announcement arrives at a critical moment for enterprise software development. Companies across industries have poured billions of dollars into AI coding tools over the past two years, hoping to dramatically accelerate their engineering output. Yet the promised productivity revolution has largely failed to materialize at scale. Zencoder's Zenflow application coordinates AI agents through structured workflows for coding tasks. (Credit: Zencoder) Why AI coding tools have failed to deliver on their 10x productivity promise Filev, who previously founded and sold the project management company Wrike to Citrix, pointed to a growing disconnect between AI coding hype and reality. While vendors have promised tenfold productivity gains, rigorous studies — including research from Stanford University — consistently show improvements closer to 20 percent. \"If you talk to real engineering leaders, I don't remember a single conversation where somebody vibe coded themselves to 2x or 5x or 10x productivity on serious engineering production,\" Filev said. \"The typical number you would hear would be about 20 percent.\" The problem, according to Filev, lies not with the AI models themselves but with how developers interact with them. The standard approach of typing requests into a chat interface and hoping for usable code works well for simple tasks but falls apart on complex enterprise projects. Zencoder's internal engineering team claims to have cracked a different approach. Filev said the company now operates at roughly twice the velocity it achieved 12 months ago, not primarily because AI models improved, but because the team restructured its development processes. \"We had to change our process and use a variety of different best practices,\" he said. Inside the four pillars that power Zencoder's AI orchestration platform Zenflow organizes its approach around four core capabilities that Zencoder argues any serious AI orchestration platform must support. Structured workflows replace ad-hoc prompting with repeatable sequences (plan, implement, test, review) that agents follow consistently. Filev drew parallels to his experience building Wrike, noting that individual to-do lists rarely scale across organizations, while defined workflows create predictable outcomes. Spec-driven development requires AI agents to first generate a technical specification, then create a step-by-step plan, and only then write code. The approach became so effective that frontier AI labs including Anthropic and OpenAI have since trained their models to follow it automatically. The specification anchors agents to clear requirements, preventing what Zencoder calls \"iteration drift,\" or the tendency for AI-generated code to gradually diverge from the original intent. Multi-agent verification deploys different AI models to critique each other's work. Because AI models from the same family tend to share blind spots, Zencoder routes verification tasks across model providers, asking Claude to review code written by OpenAI's models, or vice versa. \"Think of it as a second opinion from a doctor,\" Filev told VentureBeat. \"With the right pipeline, we see results on par with what you'd expect from Claude 5 or GPT-6. You're getting the benefit of a next-generation model today.\" Parallel execution lets developers run multiple AI agents simultaneously in isolated sandboxes, preventing them from interfering with each other's work. The interface provides a command center for monitoring this fleet, a significant departure from the current practice of managing multiple terminal windows. How verification solves AI coding's biggest reliability problem Zencoder's emphasis on verification addresses one of the most persistent criticisms of AI-generated code: its tendency to produce \"slop,\" or code that appears correct but fails in production or degrades over successive iterations. The company's internal research found that developers who skip verification often fall into what Filev called a \"death loop.\" An AI agent completes a task successfully, but the developer, reluctant to review unfamiliar code, moves on without understanding what was written. When subsequent tasks fail, the developer lacks the context to fix problems manually and instead keeps prompting the AI for solutions. \"They literally spend more than a day in that death loop,\" Filev said. \"That's why the productivity is not 2x, because they were running at 3x first, and then they wasted the whole day.\" The multi-agent verification approach also gives Zencoder an unusual competitive advantage over the frontier AI labs themselves. While Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google each optimize their own models, Zencoder can mix and match across providers to reduce bias. \"This is a rare situation where we have an edge on the frontier labs,\" Filev said. \"Most of the time they have an edge on us, but this is a rare case.\" Zencoder faces steep competition from AI giants and well-funded startups Zencoder enters the AI orchestration market at a moment of intense competition. The company has positioned itself as a model-agnostic platform, supporting major providers including Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google Gemini. In September, Zencoder expanded its platform to let developers use command-line coding agents from any provider within its interface. That strategy reflects a pragmatic acknowledgment that developers increasingly maintain relationships with multiple AI providers rather than committing exclusively to one. Zencoder's universal platform approach lets it serve as the orchestration layer regardless of which underlying models a company prefers. The company also emphasizes enterprise readiness, touting SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, and ISO 42001 certifications along with GDPR compliance. These credentials matter for regulated industries like financial services and healthcare, where compliance requirements can block adoption of consumer-oriented AI tools. But Zencoder faces formidable competition from multiple directions. Cursor and Windsurf have built dedicated AI-first code editors with devoted user bases. GitHub Copilot benefits from Microsoft's distribution muscle and deep integration with the world's largest code repository. And the frontier AI labs continue expanding their own coding capabilities. Filev dismissed concerns about competition from the AI labs, arguing that smaller players like Zencoder can move faster on user experience innovation. \"I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion, and they're smart and moving fast, so I'm sure they will catch up fairly quickly,\" he said. \"That's why I said in the next six to 12 months, you're going to see a lot of this propagating through the whole space.\" The case for adopting AI orchestration now instead of waiting for better models Technical executives weighing AI coding investments face a difficult timing question: Should they adopt orchestration tools now, or wait for frontier AI labs to build these capabilities natively into their models? Filev argued that waiting carries significant competitive risk. \"Right now, everybody is under pressure to deliver more in less time, and everybody expects engineering leaders to deliver results from AI,\" he said. \"As a founder and CEO, I do not expect 20 percent from my VP of engineering. I expect 2x.\" He also questioned whether the major AI labs will prioritize orchestration capabilities when their core business remains model development. \"In the ideal world, frontier labs should be building the best-ever models and competing with each other, and Zencoders and Cursors need to build the best-ever UI and UX application layer on top of those models,\" Filev said. \"I don't see a world where OpenAI will offer you our code verifier, or vice versa.\" Zenflow launches as a free desktop application, with updated plugins available for Visual Studio Code and JetBrains integrated development environments. The product supports what Zencoder calls \"dynamic workflows,\" meaning the system automatically adjusts process complexity based on whether a human is actively monitoring and on the difficulty of the task at hand. Zencoder said internal testing showed that replacing standard prompting with Zenflow's orchestration layer improved code correctness by approximately 20 percent on average. What Zencoder's bet on orchestration reveals about the future of AI coding Zencoder frames Zenflow as the first product in what it expects to become a significant new software category. The company believes every vendor focused on AI coding will eventually arrive at similar conclusions about the need for orchestration tools. \"I think the next six to 12 months will be all about orchestration,\" Filev predicted. \"A lot of organizations will finally reach that 2x. Not 10x yet, but at least the 2x they were promised a year ago.\" Rather than competing head-to-head with frontier AI labs on model quality, Zencoder is betting that the application layer (the software that helps developers actually use these models effectively) will determine winners and losers. It is, Filev suggested, a familiar pattern from technology history. \"This is very similar to what I observed when I started Wrike,\" he said. \"As work went digital, people relied on email and spreadsheets to manage everything, and neither could keep up.\" The same dynamic, he argued, now applies to AI coding. Chat interfaces were designed for conversation, not for orchestrating complex engineering workflows. Whether Zencoder can establish itself as the essential layer between developers and AI models before the giants build their own solutions remains an open question. But Filev seems comfortable with the race. The last time he spotted a gap between how people worked and the tools they had to work with, he built a company worth over a billion dollars.

      "text": "Patronus AI, the artificial intelligence evaluation startup backed by $20 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Datadog, unveiled a new training architecture Tuesday that it says represents a fundamental shift in how AI agents learn to perform complex tasks. The technology, which the company calls \"Generative Simulators,\" creates adaptive simulation environments that continuously generate new challenges, update rules dynamically, and evaluate an agent's performance as it learns — all in real time. The approach marks a departure from the static benchmarks that have long served as the industry standard for measuring AI capabilities but have increasingly come under fire for failing to predict real-world performance. \"Traditional benchmarks measure isolated capabilities, but they miss the interruptions, context switches, and layered decision-making that define real work,\" said Anand Kannappan, chief executive and co-founder of Patronus AI, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. \"For agents to perform at human levels, they need to learn the way humans do—through dynamic experience and continuous feedback.\" The announcement arrives at a critical moment for the AI industry. AI agents are reshaping software development, from writing code to carrying out complex instructions. Yet LLM-based agents are prone to errors and often perform poorly on complicated, multi-step tasks. Research published earlier this year found that an agent with just a 1% error rate per step can compound to a 63% chance of failure by the hundredth step — a sobering statistic for enterprises seeking to deploy autonomous AI systems at scale. Why static AI benchmarks are failing — and what comes next Patronus AI's approach addresses what the company describes as a growing mismatch between how AI systems are evaluated and how they actually perform in production. Traditional benchmarks, the company argues, function like standardized tests: they measure specific capabilities at a fixed point in time but struggle to capture the messy, unpredictable nature of real work. The new Generative Simulators architecture flips this model. Rather than presenting agents with a fixed set of questions, the system generates assignments, environmental conditions, and oversight processes on the fly, then adapts based on how the agent behaves. \"Over the past year, we've seen a shift away from traditional static benchmarks toward more interactive learning grounds,\" Rebecca Qian, chief technology officer and co-founder of Patronus AI, told VentureBeat. \"This is partly because of the innovation we've seen from model developers — the shift toward reinforcement learning, post-training, and continual learning, and away from supervised instruction tuning. What that means is there's been a collapse in the distinction between training and evaluation. Benchmarks have become environments.\" The technology builds on reinforcement learning — an approach where AI systems learn through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for mistakes. Reinforcement learning is an approach where AI systems learn to make optimal decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for their actions, improving through trial and error. RL can help agents improve, but it typically requires developers to extensively rewrite their code. This discourages adoption, even though the data these agents generate could significantly boost performance through RL training. Patronus AI also introduced a new concept it calls \"Open Recursive Self-Improvement,\" or ORSI — environments where agents can continuously improve through interaction and feedback without requiring a complete retraining cycle between attempts. The company positions this as critical infrastructure for developing AI systems capable of learning continuously rather than being frozen at a point in time. Inside the 'Goldilocks Zone': How adaptive AI training finds the sweet spot At the heart of Generative Simulators lies what Patronus AI calls a \"curriculum adjuster\" — a component that analyzes agent behavior and dynamically modifies the difficulty and nature of training scenarios. The approach draws inspiration from how effective human teachers adapt their instruction based on student performance. Qian explained the approach using an analogy: \"You can think of this as a teacher-student model, where we're training the model and the professor continually adapts the curriculum.\" This adaptive approach addresses a problem that Kannappan described as finding the \"Goldilocks Zone\" in training data — ensuring that examples are neither too easy nor too hard for a given model to learn from effectively. \"What's important is not just whether you can train on a data set, but whether you can train on a high-quality data set that's tuned to your model—one it can actually learn from,\" Kannappan said. \"We want to make sure the examples aren't too hard for the model, nor too easy.\" The company says initial results show meaningful improvements in agent performance. Training on Patronus AI's environments has increased task completion rates by 10% to 20% across real-world tasks including software engineering, customer service, and financial analysis, according to the company. The AI cheating problem: How 'moving target' environments prevent reward hacking One of the most persistent challenges in training AI agents through reinforcement learning is a phenomenon researchers call \"reward hacking\"—where systems learn to exploit loopholes in their training environment rather than genuinely solving problems. Famous examples include early agents that learned to hide in corners of video games rather than actually play them. Generative Simulators addresses this by making the training environment itself a moving target. \"Reward hacking is fundamentally a problem when systems are static. It's like students learning to cheat on a test,\" Qian said. \"But when we're continually evolving the environment, we can actually look at parts of the system that need to adapt and evolve. Static benchmarks are fixed targets; generative simulator environments are moving targets.\" Patronus AI reports 15x revenue growth as enterprise demand for agent training surges Patronus AI positions Generative Simulators as the foundation for a new product line it calls \"RL Environments\" — training grounds designed for foundation model laboratories and enterprises building agents for specific domains. The company says this offering represents a strategic expansion beyond its original focus on evaluation tools. \"We've grown 15x in revenue this year, largely due to the high-quality environments we've developed that have been shown to be extremely learnable by different kinds of frontier models,\" Kannappan said. The CEO declined to specify absolute revenue figures but said the new product has allowed the company to \"move higher up the stack in terms of where we sell and who we sell to.\" The company's platform is used by numerous Fortune 500 enterprises and leading AI companies around the world. Why OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google can't build everything in-house A central question facing Patronus AI is why the deep-pocketed laboratories developing frontier models—organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind — would license training infrastructure rather than build it themselves. Kannappan acknowledged that these companies \"are investing significantly in environments\" but argued that the breadth of domains requiring specialized training creates a natural opening for third-party providers. \"They want to improve agents on lots of different domains, whether it's coding or tool use or navigating browsers or workflows across finance, healthcare, energy, and education,\" he said. \"Solving all those different operational problems is very difficult for a single company to do.\" The competitive landscape is intensifying. Microsoft recently released Agent Lightning, an open-source framework that makes reinforcement learning work for any AI agent without rewrites. NVIDIA's NeMo Gym offers modular RL infrastructure for developing agentic AI systems. Meta researchers released DreamGym in November, a framework that simulates RL environments and dynamically adjusts task difficulty as agents improve. 'Environments are the new oil': Patronus AI's audacious bet on the future of AI training Looking ahead, Patronus AI frames its mission in sweeping terms. The company wants to \"environmentalize all of the world's data\" — converting human workflows into structured systems that AI can learn from. \"We think that everything should be an environment—internally, we joke that environments are the new oil,\" Kannappan said. \"Reinforcement learning is just one training method, but the construct of an environment is what really matters.\" Qian described the opportunity in expansive terms: \"This is an entirely new field of research, which doesn't happen every day. Generative simulation is inspired by early research in robotics and embodied agents. It's been a pipe dream for decades, and we're only now able to achieve these ideas because of the capabilities of today's models.\" The company launched in September 2023 with a focus on evaluation — helping enterprises identify hallucinations and safety issues in AI outputs. That mission has now expanded upstream into training itself. Patronus AI argues that the traditional separation between evaluation and training is collapsing — and that whoever controls the environments where AI agents learn will shape their capabilities. \"We are really at this critical point, this inflection point, where what we do right now will impact what the world is going to look like for generations to come,\" Qian said. Whether Generative Simulators can deliver on that promise remains to be seen. The company's 15x revenue growth suggests enterprise customers are hungry for solutions, but deep-pocketed players from Microsoft to Meta are racing to solve the same fundamental problem. If the last two years have taught the industry anything, it's that in AI, the future has a habit of arriving ahead of schedule.",

AI 데이터센터가 구축되면 전북 내의 스타트업, 중소기업, 대학, 연구기관은 고가의 장비를 직접 갖추지 않아도 고성능 AI 연산 자원을 활용할 수 있게 된다고 전했다. 스마트팜·농생명, 이차전지·탄소·미래차, 방산·로봇·자율주행 등 산업 분야에서 AI 기술의 현장 적용이 가속화될 것이라는 전망이다. 전북은 현재 추진 중인 피지컬 AI 실증사업과도 연계해, 모레의 AI 인프라를 로봇·드론·스마트 제조·스마트시티 등 여러 프로젝트에 활용할 방침이다. 조강원 모레 대표는 \"민간의 기술 혁신 역량과 공공의 인프라 및 정책 지원이 결합해 시너지를 창출하는 성공적인 공공-민간 파트너십 모델로 발전될 수 있도록 노력하겠다\"라고 말했다. 장세민 기자 semim99@aitimes.com",

      "text": "(사진=퍼플렉시티) 퍼플렉시티가 기존 아이폰 앱과는 별개로 아이패드용 앱을 출시했다. 고급 연구 기능을 활용하는 유료 사용자를 위한 업그레이드다. 퍼플렉시티는 16일(현지시간) 앱스토어를 통해 아이패드용 앱을 출시했다. 이 회사는 앞서 아이패드 앱을 출시했지만, 이는 휴대폰 버전을 확대한 것에 불과했다. 이번에는 퍼플렉시티의 핵심 경쟁력인 '정확한 출처 기반 답변'을 바탕으로, 일반 검색보다 더 많은 인용 정보를 학생과 전문가에게 제공한다. 복잡한 연구를 진행하는 전문가들이 단순히 챗봇과 대화하는 것을 넘어, 여러 출처를 동시에 참조하고 분석하며 보고서를 작성하는 데 최적화됐다는 설명이다. 또 아이패드의 화면 분할 기능을 활용해 사용자가 퍼플렉시티 채팅을 다른 앱과 동시에 실행할 수 있도록 했다. 여기에 모바일 버전보다 더 커진 사이드바를 통해 애플리케이션의 다른 기능을 더 쉽게 찾을 수 있어, 퍼플렉시티의 웹 버전과 흡사해졌다. 이번 개편은 퍼플렉시티가 고급 연구 기능을 확장함에 따라 비즈니스 사용자들의 사용량이 증가한 데 따른 것이라고 블룸버그를 통해 밝혔다. 이 회사의 유료 구독 서비스인 '퍼플렉시티 프로'는 고급 검색 모드와 추가 기능을 제공하는데, 아이패드 앱은 프로 사용자들의 연구 워크플로우를 완성하도록 설계됐다. 이처럼 AI 검색 경쟁이 치열해 짐에 따라, 핵심 사용자층을 겨냥한 차별화 전략으로 볼 수 있다. 퍼플렉시티는 더 많은 사용자를 확보하기 위해 다양한 플랫폼에 제품을 출시해 왔다. 최근에는 AI 브라우저인 '코멧(Comet)'을 안드로이드 기기에서도 사용할 수 있도록 했다. 몇주 안에 애플용 브라우저도 출시할 계획이다. 임대준 기자 ydj@aitimes.com",

      "text": "(사진=센드버드) \"기계적이고 반복적인 답변만 하는 챗봇은 더 이상 고객 감동을 줄 수 없습니다. 고객의 의도와 맥락을 기억하고 행동하는 서비스가 고객 경험의 혁신을 제공해 합니다.\" 센드버드(대표 김동신)는 17일 서울 송파구에서 '스파크 코리아 2025'를 열고 고객 경험 혁신 전략과 서비스 로드맵을 발표했다. 이날 컨퍼런스는 'AI 에이전트 시대, 개인화된 고객 컨시어지를 통한 딜라이트한 고객 경험'을 주제로 진행됐다. 기조연설에 나선 김동신 센드버드 대표는 현재 기업이 직면한 고객 경험의 장벽을 지적했다. 그가 꼽은 주요 문제점은 ▲단순 저장소 역할에 그친 CRM ▲수동적인 고객 지원 도구 ▲대화 맥락을 기억하지 못하는 AI 챗봇 등이다. 김 대표는 \"단순 챗봇을 넘어 고객의 상황을 능동적으로 파악하고 해결책을 제시하는 지능형 서비스로 진화가 필요한 시점\"이라며 기업들의 고객 경험 재편과 초개인화된 경험 제공의 필요성을 강조했다. 이를 해결할 방법으로 'delight.ai'를 소개했다. 이는 브랜드 정보와 고객 대화 데이터를 학습해 서비스를 제공하는 AI 에이전트다. 주요 기능으로는 ▲장기 메모리 기반 에이전트 메모리 플랫폼(AMP) ▲초개인화 맞춤형 대화(FYC) ▲다채널 연결 옴니프레젠트 AI를 갖췄다. 고객의 상황을 선제적으로 파악해 응대하며 대화 데이터를 축적해 품질을 고도화한다. 텍스트는 물론 음성, 웹, 앱 등 옴니채널 소통 환경을 지원하며 인력과 AI를 결합한 하이브리드 구조로 상담 효율성과 고객 만족도를 높였다. 여기에 '트러스트 OS' 기능으로 체계적인 거버넌스 레이어를 제공해 투명하고 안정적인 서비스를 구현했다는 설명이다. 이어진 세션에서는 이상희 센드버드코리아 대표가 가상의 온라인 쇼핑몰에서 실제 delight.ai를 이용한 고객지원 프로세스를 라이브 데모로 시연했다. 이후 맥킨지, AWS, 트웰브랩스, 마크비전, 쏘카 등이 참여해 모빌리티, 이커머스 등 다양한 산업 현장에서 AI 에이전트 도입 실사례를 공유했다. 김동신 센드버드 대표는 “AI 에이전트 시대에는 고객의 의도와 맥락을 얼마나 깊이 이해하고 일관되게 관리하는지가 브랜드 경쟁력을 좌우한다”라며 “delight.ai는 고객 여정을 통합 관리하는 브랜드 맞춤형 AI 컨시어지로 국내외 기업들의 고객 경험 전환을 위해 노력할 것”이라고 말했다. 김해원 기자 hwkim@aitimes.com",
